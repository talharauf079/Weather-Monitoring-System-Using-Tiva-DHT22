# Weather-Monitoring-System-Using-Tiva-DHT22
Weather monitoring plays an important role in human life, so the collection of information about weather changes is very important. In any industry during certain hazards it is very important to monitor weather. In this project, we will monitor different weather parameters with the help of respective sensors. These sensors will be interfaced with TM4C1233H6PM microcontroller and there output will be shown on an LCD module. These temperature parameters include temperature, humidity .Our system includes DHT 22 sensor for measuring temperature and humidity
